**Full-Stack Engineer exploring Systems & Infrastructure**

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=elixir,dotnet,js,svelte,azure,github,docker)](https://skillicons.dev)

I build enterprise web applications by day (.NET/React) and explore distributed systems in my spare time. Passionate about understanding how software works from the network layer up—not just writing features, but crafting resilient, well-architected solutions.

## **Systems and Network Engineering**

**Distributed Systems & Networking:**
- [**Pangea**](https://github.com/WillC33/pangea) - Fault-tolerant distributed monitoring platform with BEAM clustering and real-time dashboards
- [**Ambrosia**](https://github.com/WillC33/ambrosia) - Production-ready Gemini server with TLS, concurrent handling, and comprehensive security testing
- [**Ether**](https://github.com/WillC33/ether) - Raw packet sniffer for understanding network protocols at the packet level

**Web Applications:**
- [**Seasonly**](https://seasonly.org) - Phoenix LiveView community platform (live production app)
- [**ReWined**](https://rewined.net) - SvelteKit static site with localisation and performance optimisation

## **Professional Experience**

**2.5+ years** building enterprise ERP add-ons with C#/.NET and React, delivering business-critical features in regulated environments and modernising legacy systems.

## **Tech I Love**

- **Systems:** Elixir, F#, OCaml, Docker, distributed clustering
- **Enterprise:** C#, .NET, React, TypeScript, SQL Server, Azure
- **Tools:** Linux, Git, ExUnit, performance profiling

## **What I Strive For**

- **Performance-conscious** - Understanding bottlenecks from network to application layer
- **Production-ready** - Security testing, proper error handling, deployment concerns
- **Continuous learning** - Exploring functional programming paradigms and networking fundamentals
- **Open standards** - Contributing to accessible, well-documented solutions

## **Let's Connect**

Always happy to discuss systems architecture, functional programming, or interesting engineering challenges!
