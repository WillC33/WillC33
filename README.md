**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Distributed Systems & Network Programming | Elixir • Phoenix • JS • SQL • Docker**

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=elixir,js,azure,postgres,docker,dotnet,react)](https://skillicons.dev)

I am a full-stack engineer exploring systems and infrastructure. By day, I build enterprise web and integrational applications with **.NET and React**, delivering business-critical features in regulated industries like financial, audit, and construction. 

In my down time, I build with **Elixir and OTP**, specifically **Phoenix LiveView**, Deploying in the **Cloud** with **Docker**, **Postgres** and **Linux** and testing with **ExUnit, Jest, and Playwright**.

I am currently interested in exploring distributed systems, deep-diving into how software works from the network layer up, via projects that both hold my interest and serve a purpose.

## **Systems and Network Engineering**

**Distributed Systems & Networking:**
- [**Pangea**](https://github.com/WillC33/pangea) - Fault-tolerant distributed **Elixir** monitoring platform with **Distributed GenServers** via **Erlang Cookies** and **Phoenix LiveView** real-time dashboards
- [**Ambrosia**](https://github.com/WillC33/ambrosia) - Production-ready **Elixir** Gemini server with TLS, concurrent handling, and comprehensive security **TDD in ExUnit**
- [**Ether**](https://github.com/WillC33/ether) - Raw **OCaml** packet sniffer for understanding network protocols at the packet level with **C** bindings

**Web Applications:**
- [**Clamber**](https://clamber.digital) - Clamber is a **Dockerised Phoenix LiveView** and **Postgres** app for managing MVP waitlists without a backend 
- [**traceinertia**](https://traceinertia.net) - traceinertia is a **JavaScript** code-as-art project that explores broken interfaces, memory, and digital decay
- [**Seasonly**](https://seasonly.org) - **Phoenix LiveView** app aiming to connect local users with knowledge on local UK food produce
- [**ReWined**](https://rewined.net) - **SvelteKit** static site blog about non-alcoholic wines that I don't keep as up-to-date as I'd like

## **Professional Experience**

**2.5+ years** building enterprise ERP add-ons with **C#/.NET and React**, delivering business-critical features in regulated environments and modernising legacy systems.

## **Tech I Love**

- **Systems:** Elixir, F#, OCaml, Docker, distributed clustering
- **Enterprise:** C#, .NET, React, TypeScript, SQL Server, Azure
- **Tools:** Linux, Git, Neovim, ExUnit, performance profiling

## **What I Strive For**

- **Performance-conscious** - Understanding bottlenecks from network to application layer
- **Production-ready** - Security testing, proper error handling, deployment concerns
- **Continuous learning** - Exploring functional programming paradigms and networking fundamentals
- **Open standards** - Contributing to accessible, well-documented solutions

## **Let's Connect**

Always happy to discuss systems architecture, functional programming, or interesting engineering challenges!
