[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ocaml,cs,dotnet,svelte,react,js,html,css,azure,github)](https://skillicons.dev)

I'm an API enthusiast and web developer who loves building efficient, functionally-inspired solutions to problems. 
Currently, I'm exploring version control with functional patterns in nex-vcs. 
I like to emphasise performance and usability in my projects, embracing open and accessibile standards and pratices.
I could explain a monad, but then I'd have to kill you 😉
